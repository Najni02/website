            <p class="am-elements">Hey! I'm Jan – a student with a great passion for technology.
            My interests range from programme development and IT support to hacking and video editing. I am particularly fascinated by the possibilities of solving problems with code and implementing creative ideas technically.<br><br>
            I started working with software development at an early age. I love understanding systems, optimising them – and occasionally challenging them. For me, it's not just about the coding itself, but also about understanding security, user-friendliness and the interaction of different technologies.<br><br>
            In addition to the technical side, I also have a passion for video editing. Whether it's editing, effects or sound design, I enjoy turning raw material into something expressive. For me, this is an exciting balance to my technical work – and at the same time an opportunity to convey complex content in a visually appealing way.<br>  
            On this website, I give you an insight into my projects, ideas and what drives me every day. Whether it's support, development or creative challenges – I'm always looking for new ways to learn, create and grow.</p>
